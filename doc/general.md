Windows suck, and so does its dos box. We would recommend the new win11 terminal or piwersehll to have better posix compatibility

## Comments:

The **TUI_ENGINE** class has some performance overhead. With some terminal emulators this can cause flickering.
A GPU accalerated terminal such as Kitty or Alacritty should be preferred.
