# General Information

This dir contains the projects documentation.
All source-code goes into the source-directory **"/src"**.

## Requirements

For running the game, a minimal terminal size is requiered. Please maximize the terminal. 

### For Windows User

The defautl windows terminal is quite bad at rendering. 
Some flickering must be excpected. We would recommend the use of a gpu accalerated Terminal such as Kitty or Alacritty, but if a Windows environment is preferred we would recommend the new win11 terminal or powershell.

## Comments:

The **TUI_ENGINE** class has some performance overhead. With some terminal emulators this can cause flickering.
A GPU accalerated terminal such as Kitty or Alacritty should be preferred.
